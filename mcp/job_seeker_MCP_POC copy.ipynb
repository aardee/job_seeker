    "        ## Search Execution Instructions\n",
    "        ### Step 1: Broad Discovery Search\n",
    "        - Use MCP web search tools with candidate's primary keywords\n",
    "        - Search major job boards with experience level filters\n",
    "        - Cast a wide net initially to discover opportunities\n",

    "\n",
    "        ### Step 3: Deep Information Extraction\n",
    "        - For each promising job found, fetch the complete job posting\n",
    "        - Navigate to application pages to verify they're active\n",
    "        - Extract all required information fields\n",
    "\n",
    "        ### Step 4: Verification & Validation\n",
    "        - Verify job posting dates are recent (within last 30 days)\n",
    "        - Confirm application links are functional\n",
    "        - Check for duplicate postings across platforms\n",
